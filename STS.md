    <h2>Ways of Knowing Science</h2>
    <p>
      Science produces knowledge through systematic observation, experimentation,
      peer review, and consensus. Scientific knowledge is tentative and open to
      revision when new evidence or better explanations emerge.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Ways of Doing Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Technology focuses on applying scientific knowledge and human experience to
      develop tools, systems, and processes that solve practical problems and improve
      efficiency in daily life.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>The Role of Society</h2>
    <p>
      Society influences which scientific questions are prioritized and how
      technologies are used. Cultural values, economic needs, and ethical concerns
      shape both scientific research and technological development.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Ethics and Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      Ethical responsibility ensures that science and technology benefit humanity.
      Issues such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, and accountability highlight the
      importance of social oversight in technological innovation.
